# Type Checker Comparison: mypy vs basedpyright

## üìä Quick Comparison

| Feature | mypy | basedpyright |
|---------|------|--------------|
| **Speed** | Slower | Much faster (10-100x) |
| **Accuracy** | Very mature | Based on Pyright, very accurate |
| **IDE Integration** | Good | Excellent (VS Code native) |
| **Configuration** | `pyproject.toml` | `pyproject.toml` |
| **Community** | Large, established | Growing rapidly |
| **Pre-commit** | Native support | Supported |
| **Type Inference** | Good | Better |
| **Error Messages** | Good | More detailed |

## üöÄ basedpyright Advantages

1. **Performance**: Significantly faster, especially on large codebases
2. **Better Type Inference**: More sophisticated type narrowing
3. **Modern Architecture**: Built on Node.js, easier to integrate
4. **Active Development**: Based on Microsoft's Pyright, frequent updates
5. **Better Monorepo Support**: Handles multiple packages better

## ü§î mypy Advantages

1. **Maturity**: Battle-tested in production for years
2. **Plugin Ecosystem**: Django, SQLAlchemy plugins
3. **Documentation**: Extensive documentation and examples
4. **Community**: Larger community, more StackOverflow answers

## üí° Recommendation for Codemux

**I recommend basedpyright** for this project because:

1. **Speed matters**: Fast feedback loop during development
2. **Modern project**: No legacy constraints
3. **Better DX**: Superior error messages and type inference
4. **Future-proof**: Pyright is the engine behind VS Code's Python support

## üìù Configuration Example

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[tool.basedpyright]
typeCheckingMode = "strict"
pythonVersion = "3.11"
pythonPlatform = "Linux"
include = ["src"]
exclude = ["**/node_modules", "**/__pycache__", ".venv"]
reportMissingImports = true
reportMissingTypeStubs = false
reportPrivateUsage = false

# Pre-commit config
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/DetachHead/basedpyright
    rev: v1.10.0
    hooks:
      - id: basedpyright
```

## üîÑ Migration Path

If we start with basedpyright and want to switch later:
- Both use standard Python type hints
- Configuration is similar
- Easy to switch by changing tool configuration

## üéØ Decision

Given that:
- Codemux is a new project with no legacy code
- We value developer experience and fast feedback
- We're already using modern tools (uv, ruff)

**basedpyright** aligns better with our modern toolchain approach.
